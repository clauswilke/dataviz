[[no-3d]]
Don't go 3D
-----------

3D plots are quite popular, in particular in business presentations but
also among academics. They are also almost always inappropriately used.
It is rare that I see a 3D plot that couldn't be improved by turning it
into a regular 2D figure. In this chapter, I will explain why 3D plots
have problems, why they generally are not needed, and in what limited
circumstances 3D plots may be appropriate.

[[avoid-gratuitous-3d]]
Avoid gratuitous 3D
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many visualization softwares enable you to spruce up your plots by
turning the plots' graphical elements into three-dimensional objects.
Most commonly, we see pie charts turned into disks rotated in space, bar
plots turned into columns, and line plots turned into bands. Notably, in
none of these cases does the third dimension convey any actual data. 3D
is used simply to decorate and adorn the plot. I consider this use of 3D
as gratuitous. It is unequivocally bad and should be erased from the
visual vocabulary of data scientists.

The problem with gratuitous 3D is that the projection of 3D objects into
two dimensions for printing or display on a monitor distorts the data.
The human visual system tries to correct for this distortion as it maps
the 2D projection of a 3D image back into a 3D space. However, this
correction can only ever be partial. As an example, let's take a simple
pie chart with two slices, one representing 25% of the data and one 75%,
and rotate this pie in space (Figure @ref(fig:rotated-pie)). As we
change the angle at which we're looking at the pie, the size of the
slices seems to change as well. In particular, the 25% slice, which is
located in the front of the pie, looks much bigger than 25% when we look
at the pie from a flat angle (Figure @ref(fig:rotated-pie)a).

(ref:rotated-pie) The same 3D pie chart shown from four different
angles. Rotating a pie into the third dimension makes pie slices in the
front appear larger than they really are and pie slices in the back
appear smaller. Here, in parts (a), (b), and (c), the blue slice
corresponding to 25% of the data visually occupies more than 25% of the
area representing the pie. Only part (d) is an accurate representation
of the data.

(#fig:rotated-pie)(ref:rotated-pie)

Similar problems arise for other types of 3D plot. Figure
@ref(fig:titanic-3d) shows the breakdown of Titanic passengers by class
and gender using 3D bars. Because of the way the bars are arranged
relative to the axes, the bars all look shorter than they actually are.
For example, there were 322 passengers total traveling in 1st class, yet
Figure @ref(fig:titanic-3d) suggests that the number was less than 300.
This illusion arises because the columns representing the data are
located at a distance from the two back surfaces on which the gray
horizontal lines are drawn. To see this effect, consider extending any
of the bottom edges of one of the columns until it hits the lowest gray
line, which represents 0. Then, imagine doing the same to any of the top
edges, and you'll see that all columns are taller than they appear at
first glance. (See Figure @ref(fig:titanic-passengers-by-class-sex) in
Chapter @ref(visualizing-amounts) for a more reasonable 2D version of
this figure.)

(ref:titanic-3d) Numbers of female and male passengers on the Titanic
traveling in 1st, 2nd, and 3rd class, shown as a 3D stacked bar plot.
The total numbers of passengers in 1st, 2nd, and 3rd class are 322, 279,
and 711, respectively (see Figure
@ref(fig:titanic-passengers-by-class-sex)). Yet in this plot, the 1st
class bar appears to represent fewer than 300 passengers, the 3rd class
bar appears to represent fewer than 700 passengers, and the 2nd class
bar seems to be closer to 210--220 passengers than the actual 279
passengers. Furthermore, the 3rd class bar visually dominates the figure
and makes the number of passengers in 3rd class appear larger than it
actually is.

[[avoid-3d-position-scales]]
Avoid 3D position scales
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While visualizations with gratuitous 3D can easily be dismissed as bad,
it is less clear what to think of visualizations using three genuine
position scales (_x_, _y_, and _z_) to represent data. In this case, the
use of the third dimension serves an actual purpose. Nevertheless, the
resulting plots are frequently difficult to interpret, and in my mind
they should be avoided.

Consider a 3D scatter plot of fuel efficiency versus displacement and
power for 32 cars. We have seen this dataset previously in Chapter
@ref(aesthetic-mapping), Figure @ref(fig:mtcars-five-scale). Here, we
plot displacement along the _x_ axis, power along the _y_ axis, and fuel
efficiency along the _z_ axis, and we represent each car with a dot
(Figure @ref(fig:mtcars-3d)). Even though this 3D visualization is shown
from four different perspectives, it is difficult to envision how
exactly the points are distributed in space. I find part (d) of Figure
@ref(fig:mtcars-3d) particularly confusing. It almost seems to show a
different dataset, even though nothing has changed other than the angle
from which we look at the dots.

(ref:mtcars-3d) Fuel efficiency versus displacement and power for 32
cars (1973–74 models). Each dot represents one car, and the dot color
represents the number of cylinders of the car. The four panels (a)--(d)
show exactly the same data but use different perspectives. Data source:
_Motor Trend,_ 1974.

(#fig:mtcars-3d)(ref:mtcars-3d)

The fundamental problem with such 3D visualizations is that they require
two separate, successive data transformations. The first transformation
maps the data from the data space into the 3D visualization space, as
discussed in Chapters @ref(aesthetic-mapping) and
@ref(coordinate-systems-axes) in the context of position scales. The
second one maps the data from the 3D visualization space into the 2D
space of the final figure. (This second transformation obviously does
not occur for visualizations shown in a true 3D environment, such as
when shown as physical sculptures or 3D-printed objects. My primary
objection here is to 3D visualizations shown on 2D displays.) The second
transformation is non-invertible, because each point on the 2D display
corresponds to a line of points in the 3D visualization space.
Therefore, we cannot uniquely determine where in 3D space any particular
data point lies.

Our visual system nevertheless attempts to invert the 3D to 2D
transformation. However, this process is unreliable, fraught with error,
and highly dependent on appropriate cues in the image that convey some
sense of three-dimensionality. When we remove these cues the inversion
becomes entirely impossible. This can be seen in Figure
@ref(fig:mtcars-3d-no-axes), which is identical to Figure
@ref(fig:mtcars-3d) except all depth cues have been removed. The result
is four random arrangements of points that we cannot interpret at all
and that aren't even easily relatable to each other. Could you tell
which points in part (a) correspond to which points in part (b)? I
certainly cannot.

(ref:mtcars-3d-no-axes) Fuel efficiency versus displacement and power
for 32 cars (1973–74 models). The four panels (a)--(d) correspond to the
same panels in Figure @ref(fig:mtcars-3d), only that all grid lines
providing depth cues have been removed. Data source: _Motor Trend,_
1974.

(#fig:mtcars-3d-no-axes)(ref:mtcars-3d-no-axes)

Instead of applying two separate data transformations, one of which is
non-invertible, I think it is generally better to just apply one
appropriate, invertible transformation and map the data directly into 2D
space. It is rarely necessary to add a third dimension as a position
scale, since variables can also be mapped onto color, size, or shape
scales. For example, in Chapter @ref(aesthetic-mapping), I plotted five
variables of the fuel-efficency dataset at once yet used only two
position scales (Figure @ref(fig:mtcars-five-scale)).

Here, I want to show two alternative ways of plotting exactly the
variables used in Figure @ref(fig:mtcars-3d). First, if we primarily
care about fuel efficiency as the response variable, we can plot it
twice, once against displacement and once against power (Figure
@ref(fig:mtcars-2d-multiple)). Second, if we are more interested in how
displacement and power relate to each other, with fuel efficiency as a
secondary variable of interest, we can plot power versus displacement
and map fuel efficiency onto the size of the dots (Figure
@ref(fig:mtcars-2d-size)). Both figures are more useful and less
confusing than Figure @ref(fig:mtcars-3d).

power (b). Data source: _Motor Trend,_ 1974.

You may wonder whether the problem with 3D scatter plots is that the
actual data representation, the dots, do not themselves convey any 3D
information. What happens, for example, if we use 3D bars instead?
Figure @ref(fig:VA-death-rates-3d) shows a typical dataset that one
might visualize with 3D bars, the mortality rates in 1940 Virginia
stratified by age group and by gender and housing location. We can see
that indeed the 3D bars help us interpret the plot. It is unlikely that
one might mistake a bar in the foreground for one in the background or
vise versa. Nevertheless, the problems discussed in the context of
Figure @ref(fig:titanic-3d) exist here as well. It is difficult to judge
exactly how tall the individual bars are, and it is also difficult to
make direct comparisons. For example, was the mortality rate of urban
females in the 65--69 age group higher or lower than that of urban males
in the 60--64 age group?

(ref:VA-death-rates-3d) Mortality rates in Virginia in 1940, visualized
as a 3D bar plot. Mortality rates are shown for four groups of people
(urban and rural females and males) and five age categories (50--54,
55--59, 60--64, 65--69, 70--74), and they are reported in units of
deaths per 1000 persons. This figure is labeled as "bad" because the 3D
perspective makes the plot difficult to read. Data source:
@Molyneaux-et-al-1947

(#fig:VA-death-rates-3d)(ref:VA-death-rates-3d)

In general, it is better to use Trellis plots (Chapter
@ref(multi-panel-figures)) instead of 3D visualizations. The Virginia
mortality dataset requires only four panels when shown as Trellis plot
(Figure @ref(fig:VA-death-rates-Trellis)). I consider this figure clear
and easy to interpret. It is immediately obvious that mortality rates
were higher among men than among women, and also that urban males seem
to have had higher mortality rates than rural males whereas no such
trend is apparent for urban and rural females.

of deaths per 1000 persons. Data source: @Molyneaux-et-al-1947

[[appropriate-use-of-3d-visualizations]]
Appropriate use of 3D visualizations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Visualizations using 3D position scales can sometimes be appropriate,
however. First, the issues described in the preceding section are of
lesser concern if the visualization is interactive and can be rotated by
the viewer, or alternatively, if it is shown in a VR or augmented
reality environment where it can be inspected from multiple angles.
Second, even if the visualization isn't interactive, showing it slowly
rotating, rather than as a static image from one perspective, will allow
the viewer to discern where in 3D space different graphical elements
reside. The human brain is very good at reconstructing a 3D scene from a
series of images taken from different angles, and the slow rotation of
the graphic provides exactly these images.

Finally, it makes sense to use 3D visualizations when we want to show
actual 3D objects and/or data mapped onto them. For example, showing the
topographic relief of a mountainous island is a reasonable choice
(Figure @ref(fig:corsica-relief)). Similarly, if we want to visualize
the evolutionary sequence conservation of a protein mapped onto its
structure, it makes sense to show the structure as a 3D object (Figure
@ref(fig:protein-3d)). In either case, however, these visualizations
would still be easier to interpret if they were shown as rotating
animations. While this is not possible in traditional print
publications, it can be done easily when posting figures on the web or
when giving presentations.
