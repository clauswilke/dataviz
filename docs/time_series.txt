[[time-series]]
Visualizing time series and other functions of an independent variable
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The preceding chapter discussed scatter plots, where we plot one
quantitative variable against another. A special case arises when one of
the two variables can be thought of as time, because time imposes
additional structure on the data. Now the data points have an inherent
order; we can arrange the points in order of increasing time and define
a predecessor and successor for each data point. We frequently want to
visualize this temporal order and we do so with line graphs. Line graphs
are not limited to time series, however. They are appropriate whenever
one variable imposes an ordering on the data. This scenario arises also,
for example, in a controlled experiment where a treatment variable is
purposefully set to a range of different values. If we have multiple
variables that depend on time, we can either draw separate line plots or
we can draw a regular scatter plot and then draw lines to connect the
neighboring points in time.

[[individual-time-series]]
Individual time series
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As a first demonstration of a time series, we will consider the pattern
of monthly preprint submissions in biology. Preprints are scientific
articles that researchers post online before formal peer review and
publication in a scientific journal. The preprint server bioRxiv, which
was founded in November 2013 specifically for researchers working in the
biological sciences, has seen substantial growth in monthly submissions
since. We can visualize this growth by making a form of scatter plot
(Chapter @ref(visualizing-associations)) where we draw dots representing
the number of submissions in each month (Figure @ref(fig:biorxiv-dots)).

(ref:biorxiv-dots) Monthly submissions to the preprint server bioRxiv,
from its inception in November 2014 until April 2018. Each dot
represents the number of submissions in one month. There has been a
steady increase in submission volume throughout the entire 4.5-year
period. Data source: Jordan Anaya, http://www.prepubmed.org/

(#fig:biorxiv-dots)(ref:biorxiv-dots)

There is an important difference however between Figure
@ref(fig:biorxiv-dots) and the scatter plots discussed in Chapter
@ref(visualizing-associations). In Figure @ref(fig:biorxiv-dots), the
dots are spaced evenly along the _x_ axis, and there is a defined order
among them. Each dot has exactly one left and one right neighbor (except
the leftmost and rightmost points which have only one neighbor each). We
can visually emphasize this order by connecting neighboring points with
lines (Figure @ref(fig:biorxiv-dots-line)). Such a plot is called a
_line graph_.

(ref:biorxiv-dots-line) Monthly submissions to the preprint server
bioRxiv, shown as dots connected by lines. The lines do not represent
data but are only meant as a guide to the eye. By connecting the
individual dots with lines, we emphasize that there is an order between
the dots, each dot has exactly one neighbor that comes before and one
that comes after. Data source: Jordan Anaya, http://www.prepubmed.org/

(#fig:biorxiv-dots-line)(ref:biorxiv-dots-line)

Some people object to drawing lines between points because the lines do
not represent observed data. In particular, if there are only a few
observations spaced far apart, had observations been made at
intermediate times they would probably not have fallen exactly onto the
lines shown. Thus, in a sense, the lines correspond to made-up data. Yet
they may help with perception when the points are spaced far apart or
are unevenly spaced. We can somewhat resolve this dilemma by pointing it
out in the figure caption, for example by writing "lines are meant as a
guide to the eye" (see caption of Figure @ref(fig:biorxiv-dots-line)).

Using lines to represent time series is generally accepted practice,
however, and frequently the dots are omitted altogether (Figure
@ref(fig:biorxiv-line)). Without dots, the figure places more emphasis
on the overall trend in the data and less on individual observations. A
figure without dots is also visually less busy. In general, the denser
the time series, the less important it is to show individual obserations
with dots. For the preprint dataset shown here, I think omitting the
dots is fine.

(ref:biorxiv-line) Monthly submissions to the preprint server bioRxiv,
shown as a line graph without dots. Omitting the dots emphasizes the
overall temporal trend while de-emphasizing individual observations at
specific time points. It is particularly useful when the time points are
spaced very densely. Data source: Jordan Anaya,
http://www.prepubmed.org/

(#fig:biorxiv-line)(ref:biorxiv-line)

We can also fill the area under the curve with a solid color (Figure
@ref(fig:biorxiv-line-area)). This choice further emphasizes the
overarching trend in the data, because it visually separates the area
above the curve from the area below. However, this visualization is only
valid if the _y_ axis starts at zero, so that the height of the shaded
area at each time point represents the data value at that time point.

(ref:biorxiv-line-area) Monthly submissions to the preprint server
bioRxiv, shown as a line graph with filled area underneath. By filling
the area under the curve, we put even more emphasis on the overarching
temporal trend than if we just draw a line (Figure
@ref(fig:biorxiv-line)). Data source: Jordan Anaya,

[[multiple-time-series-and-dose--response-curves]]
Multiple time series and dose--response curves
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We often have multiple time courses that we want to show at once. In
this case, we have to be more careful in how we plot the data, because
the figure can become confusing or difficult to read. For example, if we
want to show the monthly submissions to multiple preprint servers, a
scatter plot is not a good idea, because the individual time courses run
into each other (Figure @ref(fig:bio-preprints-dots)). Connecting the
dots with lines alleviates this issue (Figure
@ref(fig:bio-preprints-lines)).

(ref:bio-preprints-dots) Monthly submissions to three preprint servers
covering biomedical research: bioRxiv, the q-bio section of arXiv, and
PeerJ Preprints. Each dot represents the number of submissions in one
month to the respective preprint server. This figure is labeled "bad"
because the three time courses visually interfere with each other and
are difficult to read. Data source: Jordan Anaya,
http://www.prepubmed.org/

(ref:bio-preprints-lines) Monthly submissions to three preprint servers
covering biomedical research. By connecting the dots in Figure
@ref(fig:bio-preprints-dots) with lines, we help the viewer follow each
individual time course. Data source: Jordan Anaya,

(#fig:bio-preprints-lines)(ref:bio-preprints-lines)

Figure @ref(fig:bio-preprints-lines) represents an acceptable
visualization of the preprints dataset. However, the separate legend
creates unnecessary cognitive load. We can reduce this cognitive load by
labeling the lines directly (Figure
@ref(fig:bio-preprints-direct-label)). We have also eliminated the
individual dots in this figure, for a result that is much more
streamlined and easy to read than the original starting point, Figure
@ref(fig:bio-preprints-dots).

(ref:bio-preprints-direct-label) Monthly submissions to three preprint
servers covering biomedical research. By direct labeling the lines
instead of providing a legend, we have reduced the cognitive load
required to read the figure. And the elimination of the legend removes
the need for points of different shapes. Thus, we could streamline the
figure further by eliminating the dots. Data source: Jordan Anaya,

Line graphs are not limited to time series. They are appropriate
whenever the data points have a natural order that is reflected in the
variable shown along the _x_ axis, so that neighboring points can be
connected with a line. This situation arises, for example, in
dose--response curves, where we measure how changing some numerical
parameter in an experiment (the dose) affects an outcome of interest
(the response). Figure @ref(fig:oats-yield) shows a classic experiment
of this type, measuring oat yield in response to increasing amounts of
fertilization. The line-graph visualization highlights how the
dose--response curve has a similar shape for the three oat varieties
considered but differs in the starting point in the absence of
fertilization (i.e., some varieties have naturally higher yield than
others).

(ref:oats-yield) Dose--response curve showing the mean yield of oats
varieties after fertilization with manure. The manure serves as a source
of nitrogen, and oat yields generally increase as more nitrogen is
available, regardless of variety. Here, manure application is measured
in cwt (hundredweight) per acre. The hundredweight is an old imperial
unit equal to 112 lbs or 50.8 kg. Data soure: @Yates1935

[[time-series-connected-scatter]]
Time series of two or more response variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the preceding examples we dealt with time courses of only a single
response variable (e.g., preprint submissions per month or oat yield).
It is not unusual, however, to have more than one response variable.
Such situations arise commonly in macroeconomics. For example, we may be
interested in the change in house prices from the previous 12 months as
it relates to the unemployment rate. We may expect that house prices
rise when the unemployment rate is low and vice versa.

Given the tools from the preceding subsections, we can visualize such
data as two separate line graphs stacked on top of each other (Figure
@ref(fig:house-price-unemploy)). This plot directly shows the two
variables of interest, and it is straightforward to interpret. However,
because the two variables are shown as separate line graphs, drawing
comparisons between them can be cumbersome. If we want to identify
temporal regions when both variables move in the same or in opposite
directions, we need to switch back and forth between the two graphs and
compare the relative slopes of the two curves.

unemployment rate (b) over time, from Jan. 2001 through Dec. 2017. Data

Statistics.

(#fig:house-price-unemploy)(ref:house-price-unemploy)

As an alternative to showing two separate line graphs, we can plot the
two variables against each other, drawing a path that leads from the
earliest time point to the latest (Figure @ref(fig:house-price-path)).
Such a visualization is called a _connected scatter plot_, because we
are technically making a scatter plot of the two variables against each
other and then are connecting neighboring points. Physicists and
engineers often call this a _phase portrait_, because in their
disciplines it is commonly used to represent movement in phase space. We
have previously encountered connected scatter plots in Chapter
@ref(coordinate-systems-axes), where we plotted the daily temperature
normals in Houston, TX, versus those in San Diego, CA (Figure
@ref(fig:temperature-normals-Houston-San-Diego)).

(ref:house-price-path) 12-month change in house prices versus
unemployment rate, from Jan. 2001 through Dec. 2017, shown as a
connected scatter plot. Darker shades represent more recent months. The
anti-correlation seen in Figure @ref(fig:house-price-unemploy) between
the change in house prices and the unemployment rate causes the
connected scatter plot to form two counter-clockwise circles. Data
sources: Freddie Mac House Price Index, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Original figure concept: Len Kiefer

(#fig:house-price-path)(ref:house-price-path)

In a connected scatter plot, lines going in the direction from the lower
left to the upper right represent correlated movement between the two
variables (as one variable grows, so does the other), and lines going in
the perpendicular direction, from the upper left to the lower right,
represent anti-correlated movement (as one variable grows, the other
shrinks). If the two variables have a somewhat cyclic relationship, we
will see circles or spirals in the connected scatter plot. In Figure
@ref(fig:house-price-path), we see one small circle from 2001 through
2005 and one large circle for the remainder of the time course.

When drawing a connected scatter plot, it is important that we indicate
both the direction and the temporal scale of the data. Without such
hints, the plot can turn into meaningless scribble (Figure
@ref(fig:house-price-path-bad)). I am using here (in Figure
@ref(fig:house-price-path)) a gradual darkening of the color to indicate
direction. Alternatively, one could draw arrows along the path.

(ref:house-price-path-bad) 12-month change in house prices versus
unemployment rate, from Jan. 2001 through Dec. 2017. This figure is
labeled "bad" because without the date markers and color shading of
Figure @ref(fig:house-price-path), we can see neither the direction nor
the speed of change in the data. Data sources: Freddie Mac House Prices
Index, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

(#fig:house-price-path-bad)(ref:house-price-path-bad)

Is it better to use a connected scatter plot or two separate line
graphs? Separate line graphs tend to be easier to read, but once people
are used to connected scatter plots they may be able to extract certain
patterns (such as cyclical behavior with some irregularity) that can be
difficult to spot in line graphs. In fact, to me the cyclical
relationship between change in house prices and unemployment rate is
hard to spot in Figure @ref(fig:house-price-unemploy), but the
counter-clockwise spiral in Figure @ref(fig:house-price-path) clearly
shows it. Research reports that readers are more likely to confuse order
and direction in a connected scatter plot than in line graphs and less
likely to report correlation [@Haroz_et_al_2016]. On the flip side,
connected scatter plots seem to result in higher engagement, and thus
such plots may be a effective tools to draw readers into a story
[@Haroz_et_al_2016].

Even though connected scatter plots can show only two variables at a
time, we can also use them to visualize higher-dimensional datasets. The
trick is to apply dimension reduction first (see Chapter
@ref(visualizing-associations)). We can then draw a connected
scatterplot in the dimension-reduced space. As an example of this
approach, we will visualize a database of monthly observations of over
100 macroeconomic indicators, provided by the Federal Reserve Bank of
St. Louis. We perform a principal components analysis (PCA) of all
indicators and then draw a connected scatter plot of PC 2 versus PC 1
(Figure @ref(fig:fred-md-PCA)a) and versus PC 3 (Figure
@ref(fig:fred-md-PCA)b).

(ref:fred-md-PCA) Visualizing a high-dimensional time series as a
connected scatter plot in principal components space. The path indicates
the joint movement of over 100 macroeconomic indicators from January
1990 to December 2017. Times of recession and recovery are indicated via
color, and the end points of the three recessions (March 1991, November
2001, and June 2009) are also labeled. (a) PC 2 versus PC 1. (b) PC 2
versus PC 3. Data source: M. W. McCracken, St. Louis Fed

(#fig:fred-md-PCA)(ref:fred-md-PCA)

Notably, Figure @ref(fig:fred-md-PCA)a looks almost like a regular line
plot, with time running from left to right. This pattern is caused by a
common feature of PCA: The first component often measures the overall
size of the system. Here, PC 1 approximately measures the overall size
of the economy, which rarely decreases over time.

By coloring the connected scatter plot by times of recession and
recovery, we can see that recessions are associated with a drop in PC 2
whereas recoveries do not correspond to a clear feature in either PC 1
or PC 2 (Figure @ref(fig:fred-md-PCA)a). The recoveries do, however,
seem to correspond to a drop in PC 3 (Figure @ref(fig:fred-md-PCA)b).
Moreover, in the PC 2 versus PC 3 plot, we see that the line follows the
shape of a clockwise spiral. This pattern emphasizes the cyclical nature
of the economy, with recessions following recoveries and vice versa.
