Visualizing proportions
-----------------------

We often want to show how some group, entity, or amount breaks down into
individual pieces that each represent a _proportion_ of the whole.
Common examples include the proportions of men and women in a group of
people, the percentages of people voting for different political parties
in an election, or the market shares of companies. The archetypal such
visualization is the pie chart, omnipresent in any business presentation
and much maligned among data scientists. As we will see, visualizing
proportions can be challenging, in particular when the whole is broken
into many different pieces or when we want to see changes in proportions
over time or across conditions. There is no single ideal visualization
that always works. To illustrate this issue, I discuss a few different
scenarios that each call for a different type of visualization.

Remember: You always need to pick the visualization that best fits your
specific dataset and that highlights the key data features you want to
show.

A case for pie charts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From 1961 to 1983, the German parliament (called the _Bundestag_) was
composed of members of three different parties, CDU/CSU, SPD, and FDP.
During most of this time, CDU/CSU and SPD had approximately comparable
numbers of seats, while the FDP typically held only a small fraction of
seats. For example, in the 8th Bundestag, from 1976--1980, the CDU/CSU
held 243 seats, SPD 214, and FDP 39, for a total of 496. Such
parliamentary data is most commonly visualized as a pie chart (Figure
@ref(fig:bundestag-pie)).

(ref:bundestag-pie) Party composition of the 8th German Bundestag,
1976--1980, visualized as a pie chart. This visualization shows clearly
that the ruling coalition of SPD and FDP had a small majority over the
opposition CDU/CSU.

(#fig:bundestag-pie)(ref:bundestag-pie)

A pie chart breaks a circle into slices such that the area of each slice
is proportional to the fraction of the total it represents. The same
procedure can be performed on a rectangle, and the result is a stacked
bar chart (Figure @ref(fig:bundestag-stacked-bars)). Depending on
whether we slice the bar vertically or horizontally, we obtain
vertically stacked bars (Figure @ref(fig:bundestag-stacked-bars)a) or
horizontally stacked bars (Figure @ref(fig:bundestag-stacked-bars)b).

(ref:bundestag-stacked-bars) Party composition of the 8th German
Bundestag, 1976--1980, visualized as stacked bars. (a) Bars stacked
vertically. (b) Bars stacked horizontally. It is not immediately obvious
that SPD and FDP jointly had more seats than CDU/CSU.

(#fig:bundestag-stacked-bars)(ref:bundestag-stacked-bars)

We can also take the bars from Figure @ref(fig:bundestag-stacked-bars)a
and place them side-by-side rather than stacking them on top of each
other. This visualization makes it easier to perform a direct comparison
of the three groups, though it obscures other aspects of the data
(Figure @ref(fig:bundestag-bars-side-by-side)). Most importantly, in a
side-by-side bar plot the relationship of each bar to the total is not
visually obvious.

(ref:bundestag-bars-side-by-side) Party composition of the 8th German
Bundestag, 1976--1980, visualized as side-by-side bars. As in Figure
@ref(fig:bundestag-stacked-bars), it is not immediately obvious that SPD
and FDP jointly had more seats than CDU/CSU.

(#fig:bundestag-bars-side-by-side)(ref:bundestag-bars-side-by-side)

Many authors categorically reject pie charts and argue in favor of
side-by-side or stacked bars. Others defend the use of pie charts in
some applications. My own opinion is that none of these visualizations
is consistently superior over any other. Depending on the features of
the dataset and the specific story you want to tell, you may want to
favor one or the other approach. In the case of the 8th German
Bundestag, I think that a pie chart is the best option. It shows clearly
that the ruling coalition of SPD and FDP jointly had a small majority
over the CDU/CSU (Figure @ref(fig:bundestag-pie)). This fact is not
visually obvious in any of the other plots (Figures
@ref(fig:bundestag-stacked-bars) and
@ref(fig:bundestag-bars-side-by-side)).

In general, pie charts work well when the goal is to emphasize simple
fractions, such as one-half, one-third, or one-quarter. They also work
well when we have very small datasets. A single pie chart, as in Figure
@ref(fig:bundestag-pie), looks just fine, but a single column of stacked
bars, as in Figure @ref(fig:bundestag-stacked-bars)a, looks awkward.
Stacked bars, on the other hand, can work for side-by-side comparisons
of multiple conditions or in a time series, and side-by-side bars are
preferred when we want to directly compare the individual fractions to
each other. A summary of the various pros and cons of pie charts,
stacked bars, and side-by-side bars is provided in Table
@ref(tab:pros-cons-pie-bar).

[[side-by-side-bars]]
A case for side-by-side bars
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I will now demonstrate a case where pie charts fail. This example is
modeled after a critique of pie charts originally posted on Wikipedia
[@Schutz-piecharts]. Consider the hypothetical scenario of five
companies, A, B, C, D, and E, who all have roughly comparable market
share of approximately 20%. Our hypothetical dataset lists the market
share of each company for three consecutive years. When we visualize
this dataset with pie charts, it is difficult to see what exactly is
going on (Figure @ref(fig:marketshare-pies)). It appears that the market
share of company A is growing and the one of company E is shrinking, but
beyond this one observation we can't tell what's going on. In
particular, it is unclear how exactly the market shares of the different
companies compare within each year.

(ref:marketshare-pies) Market share of five hypothetical companies,
A--E, for the years 2015--2017, visualized as pie charts. This
visualization has two major problems: 1. A comparison of relative market
share within years is nearly impossible. 2. Changes in market share
across years are difficult to see.

(#fig:marketshare-pies)(ref:marketshare-pies)

The picture becomes a little clearer when we switch to stacked bars
(Figure @ref(fig:marketshare-stacked)). Now the trends of a growing
market share for company A and a shrinking market share for company E
are clearly visible. However, the relative market shares of the five
companies within each year are still hard to compare. And it is
difficult to compare the market shares of companies B, C, and D across
years, because the bars are shifted relative to each other across years.
This is a general problem of stacked-bar plots, and the main reason why
I normally do not recommend this type of visualization.

(ref:marketshare-stacked) Market share of five hypothetical companies
for the years 2015--2017, visualized as stacked bars. This visualization
has two major problems: 1. A comparison of relative market shares within
years is difficult. 2. Changes in market share across years are
difficult to see for the middle companies B, C, and D, because the
location of the bars changes across years.

(#fig:marketshare-stacked)(ref:marketshare-stacked)

For this hypothetical data set, side-by-side bars are the best choice
(Figure @ref(fig:marketshare-side-by-side)). This visualization
highlights that both companies A and B have increased their market share
from 2015 to 2017 while both companies D and E have reduced theirs. It
also shows that market shares increase sequentially from company A to E
in 2015 and similarly decrease in 2017.

companies for the years 2015--2017, visualized as side-by-side bars.

[[stacked-densities]]
A case for stacked bars and stacked densities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Section @ref(side-by-side-bars), I wrote that I don't normally
recommend sequences of stacked bars, because the location of the
internal bars shifts along the sequence. However, the problem of
shifting internal bars disappears if there are only two bars in each
stack, and in those cases the resulting visualization can be quite
clear. As an example, consider the proportion of women in a country's
national parliament. We will specifically look at the African country
Rwanda, which as of 2016 tops the list of countries with the highest
proportion of female parliament members. Rwanda has had a majority
female parliament since 2008, and since 2013 nearly two-thirds of its
members of parliament are female. To visualize how the proportion of
women in the Rwandan parliament has changed over time, we can draw a
sequence of stacked bar graphs (Figure @ref(fig:women-parliament)). This
figure provides an immediate visual representation of the changing
proportions over time. To help the reader see exactly when the majority
turned female, I have added a dashed horizontal line at 50%. Without
this line, it would be near impossible to determine whether from 2003 to
2007 the majority was male or female. I have not added similar lines at
25% and 75%, to avoid making the figure too cluttered.

(ref:women-parliament) Change in the gender composition of the Rwandan
parliament over time, 1997 to 2016. Data source: Inter-Parliamentary
Union (IPU), ipu.org.

(#fig:women-parliament)(ref:women-parliament)

If we want to visualize how proportions change in response to a
continuous variable, we can switch from stacked bars to stacked
densities. Stacked densities can be thought of as the limiting case of
infinitely many infinitely small stacked bars arranged side-by-side. The
densities in stacked-density plots are typically obtained from kernel
density estimation, as described in Chapter
@ref(histograms-density-plots), and I refer you to that chapter for a
general discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of this method.

To give an example where stacked densities may be appropriate, consider
the health status of people as a function of age. Age can be considered
a continuous variable, and visualizing the data in this way works
reasonably well (Figure @ref(fig:health-vs-age)). Even though we have
four health categories here, and I'm generally not a fan of stacking
multiple conditions, as discussed above, I think in this case the figure
is acceptable. We can see clearly that overall health declines as people
age, and we can also see that despite this trend, over half of the
population remain in good or excellent health until very old age.

(ref:health-vs-age) Health status by age, as reported by the general
social survey (GSS).

(#fig:health-vs-age)(ref:health-vs-age)

Nevertheless, this figure has a major limitation: By visualizing the
proportions of the four health conditions as percent of the total, the
figure obscures that there are many more young people than old people in
the dataset. Thus, even though the _percentage_ of people reporting to
be in good health remains approximately unchanged across ages spanning
seven decades, the _absolute number_ of people in good health declines
as the total number of people at a given age declines. I will present a
potential solution to this problem in the next section.

[[visualizing-proportions-separately-as-parts-of-the-total]]
Visualizing proportions separately as parts of the total
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Side-by-side bars have the problem that they don't clearly visualize the
size of the individual parts relative to the whole and stacked bars have
the problem that the different bars cannot be compared easily because
they have different baselines. We can resolve these two issues by making
a separate plot for each part and in each plot showing the respective
part relative to the whole. For the health dataset of Figure
@ref(fig:health-vs-age), this procedure results in Figure
@ref(fig:health-vs-age-facets). The overall age distribution in the
dataset is shown as the shaded gray areas, and the age distributions for
each health status are shown in blue. This figure highlights that in
absolute terms, the number people with excellent or good health declines
past ages 30--40, while the number of people with fair health remains
approximately constant across all ages.

(ref:health-vs-age-facets) Health status by age, shown as proportion of
the total number of people in the survey. The colored areas show the
density estimates of the ages of people with the respective health
status and the gray areas show the overall age distribution.

(#fig:health-vs-age-facets)(ref:health-vs-age-facets)

To provide a second example, let's consider a different variable from
the same survey: marital status. Marital status changes much more
drastically with age than does health status, and a stacked densities
plot of marital status vs age is not very illuminating (Figure
@ref(fig:marital-vs-age)).

(ref:marital-vs-age) Marital status by age, as reported by the general
social survey (GSS). To simplify the figure, I have removed a small
number of cases that report as separated. I have labeled this figure as
"bad" because the frequency of people who have never been married or are
widowed changes so drastically with age that the age distributions of
married and divorced people are highly distorted and difficult to
interpret.

(#fig:marital-vs-age)(ref:marital-vs-age)

The same dataset visualized as partial densities is much clearer (Figure
@ref(fig:marital-vs-age-facets)). In particular, we see that the
proportion of married people peaks around the late 30s, the proportion
of divorced people peaks around the early 40s, and the proportion of
widowed people peaks around the mid 70s.

(ref:marital-vs-age-facets) Marital status by age, shown as proportion
of the total number of people in the survey. The colored areas show the
density estimates of the ages of people with the respective marital
status, and the gray areas show the overall age distribution.

(#fig:marital-vs-age-facets)(ref:marital-vs-age-facets)

However, one downside of Figure @ref(fig:marital-vs-age-facets) is that
this representation doesn't make it easy to determine relative
proportions at any given point in time. For example, if we wanted to
know at what age more than 50% of all people surveyed are married, we
could not easily tell from Figure @ref(fig:marital-vs-age-facets). To
answer this question, we can instead use the same type of display but
show relative proportions instead of absolute counts along the _y_ axis
(Figure @ref(fig:marital-vs-age-proportions)). Now we see that married
people are in the majority starting in their late 20s, and widowed
people are in the majority starting in their mid 70s.

(ref:marital-vs-age-proportions) Marital status by age, shown as
proportion of the total number of people in the survey. The areas
colored in blue show the percent of people at the given age with the
respective status, and the areas colored in gray show the percent of
people with all other marital statuses.
