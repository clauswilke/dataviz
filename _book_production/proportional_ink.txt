[[proportional-ink]]
The principle of proportional ink
---------------------------------

In many different visualization scenarios, we represent data values by
the extent of a graphical element. For example, in a bar plot, we draw
bars that begin at 0 and end at the data value they represent. In this
case, the data value is not only encoded in the end point of the bar but
also in the height or length of the bar. If we drew a bar that started
at a different value than 0, then the length of the bar and the bar
endpoint would convey contradicting information. Such figures are
internally inconsistent, because they show two different values with the
same graphical element. Contrast this to a scenario where we visualize
the data value with a dot. In this case, the value is only encoded in
the location of the dot but not in the size or shape of the dot.

Similar issues will arise whenever we use graphical elements such as
bars, rectangles, shaded areas of arbitrary shape, or any other elements
that have a clear visual extent which can be either consistent or
inconsistent with the data value shown. In all these cases, we need to
make sure that there is no inconsistency. This concept has been termed
by Bergstrom and West as the _principle of proportional ink_
[@BergstromWest2016]:

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
*The principle of proportional ink:* The sizes of shaded areas in a
visualization need to be proportional to the data values they represent.
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

(It is common practice to use the word "ink" to refer to any part of a
visualization that deviates from the background color. This includes
lines, points, shared areas, and text. In this chapter, however, we are
talking primarily about shaded areas.) Violations of this principle are
quite common, in particular in the popular press and in the world of
finance.

[[visualizations-along-linear-axes]]
Visualizations along linear axes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We first consider the most common scenario, visualization of amounts
along a linear scale. Figure @ref(fig:hawaii-income-bars-bad) shows the
median income in the five counties that make up the state of Hawaii. It
is a typical figure one might encounter in a newspaper article. A quick
glance at the figure suggests that the county of Hawaii is incredibly
poor while the county of Honolulu is much richer than the other
counties. However, Figure @ref(fig:hawaii-income-bars-bad) is quite
misleading, because all bars begin at $50,000 median income. Thus, while
the endpoint of each bar correctly represents the actual median income
in each county, the bar height represents the extent to which median
incomes exceed $50,000, an arbitrary number. And human perception is
such that the bar height is the key quantity we perceive when looking at
this figure, not the location of the bar endpoint relative to the _y_
axis.

(ref:hawaii-income-bars-bad) Median income in the five counties of the
state of Hawaii. This figure is misleading, because the _y_ axis scale
starts at $50,000 instead of $0. As a result, the bar heights are not
proportional to the values shown, and the income differential between
the county of Hawaii and the other four counties appears much bigger
than it actually is. Data source: 2015 Five-Year American Community
Survey.

(#fig:hawaii-income-bars-bad)(ref:hawaii-income-bars-bad)

An appropriate visualization of these data makes for a less exciting
story (Figure @ref(fig:hawaii-income-bars-good)). While there are
differences in median income between the counties, they are nowhere near
as big as Figure @ref(fig:hawaii-income-bars-bad) suggested. Overall,
the median incomes in the different counties are somewhat comparable.

(ref:hawaii-income-bars-good) Median income in the five counties of the
state of Hawaii. Here, the _y_ axis scale starts at $0 and therefore the
relative magnitudes of the median incomes in the five counties are
accurately shown. Data source: 2015 Five-Year American Community Survey.

(#fig:hawaii-income-bars-good)(ref:hawaii-income-bars-good)

Bars on a linear scale should always start at 0.

Similar visualization problems frequently arise in the visualization of
time series, such as those of stock prices. Figure
@ref(fig:fb-stock-drop-bad) suggests a massive collapse in the stock
price of Facebook occurred around Nov. 1, 2016. In reality, the price
decline was moderate relative to the total price of the stock (Figure
@ref(fig:fb-stock-drop-good)). The _y_-axis range in Figure
@ref(fig:fb-stock-drop-bad) would be questionable even without the
shading undearneath the curve. But with the shading, the figure becomes
particularly problematic. The shading emphasizes the distance from the
location of the _x_ axis to the specific _y_ values shown, and thus it
creates the visual impression that the height of the shaded area at a
given day represents the stock price of that day. Instead, it only
represents the difference in stock price from the baseline, which is
$110 in Figure @ref(fig:fb-stock-drop-bad).

(ref:fb-stock-drop-bad) Stock price of Facebook (FB) from Oct. 22, 2016
to Jan. 21, 2017. This figure seems to imply that the Facebook stock
price collapsed around Nov. 1, 2016. However, this is misleading,
because the _y_ axis starts at $110 instead of $0.

(#fig:fb-stock-drop-bad)(ref:fb-stock-drop-bad)

(ref:fb-stock-drop-good) Stock price of Facebook (FB) from Oct. 22, 2016
to Jan. 21, 2017. By showing the stock price on a _y_ scale from $0 to
$150, this figure more accurately relays the magnitude of the FB price
drop around Nov. 1, 2016.

(#fig:fb-stock-drop-good)(ref:fb-stock-drop-good)

The examples of Figures @ref(fig:hawaii-income-bars-good) and Figure
@ref(fig:fb-stock-drop-good) could suggest that bars and shaded areas
are not useful to represent small changes over time or differences
between conditions, since we always have to draw the whole bar or area
starting from 0. However, this is not the case. It is perfectly valid to
use bars or shaded areas to show differences between conditions, as long
as we make it explicit which differences we are showing. For example, we
can use bars to visualize the change in median income in Hawaiian
counties from 2010 to 2015 (Figure @ref(fig:hawaii-income-change)). For
all counties except Kalawao, this change amounts to less than $5000.
(Kalawao is an unusual county, with fewer than 100 inhabitants, and it
can experience large swings in median income from a small number of
people moving into or out of the county.) And for Hawaii County, the
change is negative, i.e., the median income in 2015 was lower than it
was in 2010. We represent negative values by drawing bars that go in the
opposite direction, i.e., that extend from 0 down rather than up.

(ref:hawaii-income-change) Change in median income in Hawaiian counties
from 2010 to 2015. Data source: 2010 and 2015 Five-Year American
Community Surveys.

(#fig:hawaii-income-change)(ref:hawaii-income-change)

Similarly, we can draw the change in Facebook stock price over time as
the difference from its temporary high point on Oct. 22, 2016 (Figure
@ref(fig:fb-stock-drop-inverse)). By shading an area that represents the
distance from the high point, we are accurately representing the
absolute magnitude of the price drop without making any implicit
statement about the magnitude of the price drop relative to the total
stock price.

(ref:fb-stock-drop-inverse) Loss in Facebook (FB) stock price relative
to the price of Oct. 22, 2016. Between Nov. 1, 2016 and Jan. 1, 2017,
the price remained approximately $15 lower than it was at its high point
on Oct. 22, 2016. But then the price started to recover in Jan. 2017.

[[visualizations-along-logarithmic-axes]]
Visualizations along logarithmic axes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When we are visualizing data along a linear scale, the areas of bars,
rectangles, or other shapes are automatically proportional to the data
values. The same is not true if we are using a logarithmic scale,
because data values are not linearly spaced along the axis. Therefore,
one could argue that, for example, bar graphs on a log scale are
inherently flawed. On the flip side, the area of each bar will be
proportional to the logarithm of the data value, and thus bar graphs on
a log scale satisfy the principle of proportional ink in log-transformed
coordinates. In practice, I think neither of these two arguments can
resolve whether log-scale bar graphs are appropriate. Instead, the
relevant question is whether we want to visualize amounts or ratios.

In Chapter @ref(coordinate-systems-axes), I have explained that a log
scale is the natural scale to visualize ratios, because a unit step
along a log scale corresponds to multiplication with or division by a
constant factor. In practice, however, log scales are often used not
specifically to visualize ratios but rather just because the numbers
shown vary over many orders of magnitude. As an example, consider the
gross domestic products (GDPs) of countries in Oceania. In 2007, these
varied from less than a billion U.S. dollars (USD) to over 300 billion
USD (Figure @ref(fig:oceania-gdp-logbars)). Visualizing these numbers on
a linear scale would not work, because the two countries with the
largest GDPs (New Zealand and Australia) would dominate the figure.

(ref:oceania-gdp-logbars) GDP in 2007 of countries in Oceania. The
lengths of the bars do not accurately reflect the data values shown,
since bars start at the arbitrary value of 0.3 billion USD. Data source:
Gapminder.

(#fig:oceania-gdp-logbars)(ref:oceania-gdp-logbars)

However, the visualization with bars on a log scale (Figure
@ref(fig:oceania-gdp-logbars)) does not work either. The bars start at
an arbitrary value of 0.3 billion USD, and at a minimum the figure
suffers from the same problem of Figure
@ref(fig:hawaii-income-bars-bad), that the bar lengths are not
representative of the data values. The added difficulty with a log
scale, though, is that we cannot simply let the bars start at 0. In
Figure @ref(fig:oceania-gdp-logbars), the value 0 would lie infinitely
far to the left. Therefore, we could make our bars arbitrary long by
pushing their origin further and further way, see e.g. Figure
@ref(fig:oceania-gdp-logbars-long). This problem always arises when we
try to visualize amounts (which is what the GDP values are) on a log
scale.

(ref:oceania-gdp-logbars-long) GDP in 2007 of countries in Oceania. The
lengths of the bars do not accurately reflect the data values shown,
since bars start at the arbitrary value of 10-9 billion USD. Data
source: Gapminder.

(#fig:oceania-gdp-logbars-long)(ref:oceania-gdp-logbars-long)

For the data of Figure @ref(fig:oceania-gdp-logbars), I think bars are
inappropriate. Instead, we can simply place a dot at the appropriate
location along the scale for each country's GDP and avoid the issue of
bar lengths altogether (Figure @ref(fig:oceania-gdp-dots)). Importantly,
by placing the country names right next to the dots rather than along
the _y_ axis, we avoid generating the visual perception of a magnitude
conveyed by the distance from the country name to the dot.

(ref:oceania-gdp-dots) GDP in 2007 of countries in Oceania. Data source:
Gapminder.

(#fig:oceania-gdp-dots)(ref:oceania-gdp-dots)

If we want to visualize ratios rather than amounts, however, bars on a
log scale are a perfectly good option. In fact, they are preferable over
bars on a linear scale in that case. As an example, let's visualize the
GDP values of countries in Oceania relative to the GDP of Papua New
Guinea. The resulting figure does a good job highlighting the key
relationships between the GDPs of the various countries (Figure
@ref(fig:oceania-gdp-relative)). We can see that New Zealand has over
eight times the GDP of Papua New Guinea and Australia over 64 times,
while Tonga and the Federated States of Micronesia have less than
one-sixteenth of the GDP of Papua New Guinea. French Polynesia and New
Caledonia are close but have a slightly smaller GDPs than Papua New
Guinea does.

(ref:oceania-gdp-relative) GDP in 2007 of countries in Oceania, relative
to the GDP of Papua New Guinea. Data source: Gapminder.

(#fig:oceania-gdp-relative)(ref:oceania-gdp-relative)

Figure @ref(fig:oceania-gdp-relative) also highlights that the natural
midpoint of a log scale is 1, with bars representing numbers above 1
going in one direction and bars representing numbers below one going in
the other direction. Bars on a log scale represent ratios and must
always start at 1, and bars on a linear scale represent amounts and must
always start at 0.

When bars are drawn on a log scale, they represent ratios and need to be
drawn starting from 1, not 0.

[[direct-area-visualizations]]
Direct area visualizations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All preceding examples visualized data along one linear dimension, so
that the data value was encoded both by area and by location along the
_x_ or _y_ axis. In these cases, we can consider the area encoding as
incidental and secondary to the location encoding of the data value.
Other visualization approaches, however, represent the data value
primarily or directly by area, without a corresponding location mapping.
The most common one is the pie chart (Figure @ref(fig:RI-pop-pie)). Even
though technically the data values are mapped onto angles, which are
represented by location along a circular axis, in practice we are
typically not judging the angles of a pie chart. Instead, the dominant
visual property we notice is the size of the areas of each pie wedge.

(ref:RI-pop-pie) Number of inhabitants in Rhode Island counties, shown
as a pie chart. Both the angle and the area of each pie wedge are
proportional to the number of inhabitants in the respective county. Data
source: 2010 Decennial U.S. Census.

(#fig:RI-pop-pie)(ref:RI-pop-pie)

Because the area of each pie wedge is proportional to its angle which is
proportional to the data value the wedge represents, pie charts satisfy
the principle of proportional ink. However, we perceive the area in a
pie chart differently from the same area in a bar plot. The fundamental
reason is that human perception primarily judges distances and not
areas. Thus, if a data value is encoded entirely as a distance, as is
the case with the length of a bar, we perceive it more accurately than
when the data value is encoded through a combination of two or more
distances that jointly create an area. To see this difference, compare
Figure @ref(fig:RI-pop-pie) to Figure @ref(fig:RI-pop-bars), which shows
the same data as bars. The difference in the number of inhabitants
between Providence County and the other counties appears larger in
Figure @ref(fig:RI-pop-bars) than in Figure @ref(fig:RI-pop-pie).

(ref:RI-pop-bars) Number of inhabitants in Rhode Island counties, shown
as bars. The length of each bar is proportional to the number of
inhabitants in the respective county. Data source: 2010 Decennial U.S.
Census.

(#fig:RI-pop-bars)(ref:RI-pop-bars)

The problem that human perception is better at judging distances than at
judging areas also arises in treemaps (Figure @ref(fig:RI-pop-treemap)),
which can be thought of as a square versions of pie charts. Again, in
comparison to Figure @ref(fig:RI-pop-bars), the differences in the
number of inhabitants among the counties appears less pronounced in
Figure @ref(fig:RI-pop-treemap).

(ref:RI-pop-treemap) Number of inhabitants in Rhode Island counties,
shown as a treemap. The area of each rectangle is proportional to the
number of inhabitants in the respective county. Data source: 2010
Decennial U.S. Census.
