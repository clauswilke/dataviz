[[balance-data-context]]
Balance the data and the context
--------------------------------

We can broadly subdivide the graphical elements in any visualization
into elements that represent data and elements that do not. The former
are elements such as the points in a scatter plot, the bars in a
histogram or barplot, or the shaded areas in a heatmap. The latter are
elements such as plot axes, axis ticks and labels, axis titles, legends,
and plot annotations. These elements generally provide context for the
data and/or visual structure to the plot. When designing a plot, it can
be helpful to think about the amount of ink (Chapter
@ref(proportional-ink)) used to represent data and context. A common
recommendation is to reduce the amount of non-data ink, and following
this advice can often yield less cluttered and more elegant
visualizations. At the same time, context and visual structure are
important, and overly minimizing the plot elements that provide them can
result in figures that are difficult to read, confusing, or simply not
that compelling.

[[providing-the-appropriate-amount-of-context]]
Providing the appropriate amount of context
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The idea that distinguishing between data and non-data ink may be useful
was popularized by Edward Tufte in his book "The Visual Display of
Quantitative Information" [@TufteQuantDispl]. Tufte introduces the
concept of the "data--ink ratio", which he defines as the "proportion of
a graphic's ink devoted to the non-redundant display of
data-information." He then writes (emphasis mine):

______________________________________________
Maximize the data--ink ratio, _within reason._
______________________________________________

I have emphasized the phrase "within reason" because it is critical and
frequently forgotten. In fact, I think that Tufte himself forgets it in
the remainder of his book, where he advocates overly minimalistic
designs that, in my opinion, are neither elegant nor easy to decipher.
If we interpret the phrase "maximize the data--ink ratio" to mean
"remove clutter and strive for clean and elegant designs," then I think
it is reasonable advice. But if we interpret it as "do everything you
can to remove non-data ink" then it will result in poor design choices.
If we go too far in either direction we will end up with ugly figures.
However, away from the extremes there is wide range of designs that are
all acceptable and may be appropriate in different settings.

To explore the extremes, let's consider a figure that clearly has too
much non-data ink (Figure @ref(fig:Aus-athletes-grid-bad)). The colored
points in the plot panel (the framed center area containing data points)
are data ink. Everything else is non-data ink. The non-data ink includes
a frame around the entire figure, a frame around the plot panel, and a
frame around the legend. None of these frames are needed. We also see a
prominent and dense background grid that draws attention away from the
actual data points. By removing the frames and minor grid lines and by
drawing the major grid lines in a light gray, we arrive at Figure
@ref(fig:Aus-athletes-grid-good). In this version of the figure, the
actual data points stand out much more clearly, and they are perceived
as the most important component of the figure.

(ref:Aus-athletes-grid-bad) Percent body fat versus height in
professional male Australian athletes. Each point represents one
athlete. This figure devotes way too much ink to non-data. There are
unnecessary frames around the entire figure, around the plot panel, and
around the legend. The coordinate grid is very prominent, and its
presence draws attention away from the data points. Data source:
@Telford-Cunningham-1991

(#fig:Aus-athletes-grid-bad)(ref:Aus-athletes-grid-bad)

(ref:Aus-athletes-grid-good) Percent body fat versus height in
professional male Australian athletes. This figure is a cleaned-up
version of Figure @ref(fig:Aus-athletes-grid-bad). Unnecessary frames
have been removed, minor grid lines have been removed, and major grid
lines have been drawn in light gray to stand back relative to the data
points. Data source: @Telford-Cunningham-1991

(#fig:Aus-athletes-grid-good)(ref:Aus-athletes-grid-good)

At the other extreme, we might end up with a figure such as Figure
@ref(fig:Aus-athletes-min-bad), which is a minimalist version of Figure
@ref(fig:Aus-athletes-grid-good). In this figure, the axis tick labels
and titles have been made so faint that they are hard to see. If we just
glance at the figure we will not immediately perceive what data is
actually shown. We only see points floating in space. Moreover, the
legend annotations are so faint that the points in the legend could be
mistaken for data points. This effect is amplified because there is no
clear visual separation between the plot area and the legend. Notice how
the background grid in Figure @ref(fig:Aus-athletes-grid-good) both
anchors the points in space and sets off the data area from the legend
area. Both of these effects have been lost in Figure
@ref(fig:Aus-athletes-min-bad).

(ref:Aus-athletes-min-bad) Percent body fat versus height in
professional male Australian athletes. In this example, the concept of
removing non-data ink has been taken too far. The axis tick labels and
title are too faint and are barely visible. The data points seem to
float in space. The points in the legend are not sufficiently set off
from the data points, and the casual observer might think they are part
of the data. Data source: @Telford-Cunningham-1991

(#fig:Aus-athletes-min-bad)(ref:Aus-athletes-min-bad)

In Figure @ref(fig:Aus-athletes-grid-good), I am using an open
background grid and no axis lines or frame around the plot panel. I like
this design because it conveys to the reader that range of possible data
values extends beyond the axis limits. For example, even though Figure
@ref(fig:Aus-athletes-grid-good) shows no athlete taller than 210 cm,
such an athlete could conceivably exist. However, some authors prefer to
delineate the extent of the plot panel, by drawing a frame around it
(Figure @ref(fig:Aus-athletes-grid-good-frame)). Both options are
reasonable, and which is preferable is primarily a matter of personal
opinion. One advantage of the framed version is that it clearly
separates the legend from the plot panel.

(ref:Aus-athletes-grid-good-frame) Percent body fat versus height in
professional male Australian athletes. This figure adds a frame around
the plot panel of Figure @ref(fig:Aus-athletes-grid-good), and this
frame helps separate the legend from the data. Data source:
@Telford-Cunningham-1991

(#fig:Aus-athletes-grid-good-frame)(ref:Aus-athletes-grid-good-frame)

Figures with too little non-data ink commonly suffer from the effect
that figure elements appear to float in space, without clear connection
or reference to anything. This problem tends to be particularly severe
in small multiples plots. Figure
@ref(fig:titanic-survival-by-gender-class-bad) shows a small-multiples
plot comparing six different bar plots, but it looks more like a piece
of modern art than a useful data visualization. The bars are not
anchored to a clear baseline and the individual plot facets are not
clearly delineated. We can resolve these issues by adding a light gray
background and thin horizontal grid lines to each facet (Figure
@ref(fig:titanic-survival-by-gender-class)).

(ref:titanic-survival-by-gender-class-bad) Survival of passengers on the
Titanic, broken down by gender and class. This small-multiples plot is
too minimalistic. The individual factes are not framed, so it's
difficult to see which part of the figure belongs to which facet.
Further, the individual bars are not anchored to a clear baseline, and
they seem to float.

(#fig:titanic-survival-by-gender-class-bad)(ref:titanic-survival-by-gender-class-bad)

(ref:titanic-survival-by-gender-class) Survival of passengers on the
Titanic, broken down by gender and class. This is an improved version of
Figure @ref(fig:titanic-survival-by-gender-class-bad). The gray
background in each facet clearly delineates the six groupings (survived
or died in first, second, or third class) that make up this plot. Thin
horizontal lines in the background provide a reference for the bar
heights and facility comparison of bar heights among facets.

[[background-grids]]
Background grids
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Gridlines in the background of a plot can help the reader discern
specific data values and compare values in one part of a plot to values
in another part. At the same time, gridlines can add visual noise, in
particular when they are prominent or densely spaced. Reasonable people
can disagree about whether to use a grid or not, and if so how to format
it and how densely to space it. Throughout this book I am using a
variety of different grid styles, to highlight that there isn't
necessarily one best choice.

The R software ggplot2 has popularized a style using a fairly prominent
background grid of white lines on a gray background. Figure
@ref(fig:price-plot-ggplot-default) shows an example in this style. The
figure displays the change in stock price of four major tech companies
over a five-year window, from 2012 to 2017. With apologies to the
ggplot2 author Hadley Wickham, for whom I have the utmost respect, I
don't find the white-on-gray background grid particularly attractive. To
my eye, the gray background can detract from the actual data, and a grid
with major and minor lines can be too dense. I also find the gray
squares in the legend confusing.

(ref:price-plot-ggplot-default) Stock price over time for four major
tech companies. The stock price for each company has been normalized to
equal 100 in June 2012. This figure mimics the ggplot2 default look,
with white major and minor grid lines on a gray background. In this
particular example, I think the grid lines overpower the data lines, and
the result is a figure that is not well balanced and that doesn't place
sufficient emphasis on the data. Data source: Yahoo Finance

(#fig:price-plot-ggplot-default)(ref:price-plot-ggplot-default)

Arguments in favor of the gray background include that it (i) helps the
plot to be perceived as a single visual entity and (ii) prevents the
plot to appear as a white box in surrounding dark text [@Wickham2016]. I
completely agree with the first point, and it was the reason I used gray
backgrounds in Figure @ref(fig:titanic-survival-by-gender-class). For
the second point, I'd like to caution that the perceived darkness of
text will depend on the font size, fontface, and line spacing, and the
perceived darkness of a figure will depend on the absolute amount and
color of ink used, including all data ink. A scientific paper typeset in
dense, 10-point Times New Roman will look much darker than a
coffee-table book typeset in 14-point Palatino with one-and-a-half line
spacing. Likewise, a scatter plot of five points in yellow will look
much lighter than a scatter plot of 10,000 points in black. If you want
to use a gray figure background, consider the color intensity of your
figure foreground, as well as the expected layout and typography of the
text around your figures, and adjust the choice of your background gray
accordingly. Otherwise, it could happen that your figures end up
standing out as dark boxes among the surrounding lighter text. Also,
keep in mind that the colors you use to plot your data need to work with
the gray background. We tend to perceive colors differently against
different backgrounds, and a gray background requires darker and more
saturated foreground colors than a white background.

We can go all the way in the opposite direction and remove both the
background and the grid lines (Figure @ref(fig:price-plot-no-grid)). In
this case, we need visible axis lines to frame the plot and keep it as a
single visual unit. For this particular figure, I think this choice is a
worse option, and I have labeled it as "bad". In the absence of any
background grid whatsoever, the curves seem to float in space, and it's
difficult to reference the final values on the right to the axis ticks
on the left.

(ref:price-plot-no-grid) Indexed stock price over time for four major
tech companies. In this variant of Figure
@ref(fig:price-plot-ggplot-default), the data lines are not sufficiently
anchored. This makes it difficult to ascertain to what extent they have
deviated from the index value of 100 at the end of the covered time
interval. Data source: Yahoo Finance

(#fig:price-plot-no-grid)(ref:price-plot-no-grid)

At the absolute minimum, we need to add one horizontal reference line.
Since the stock prices in Figure @ref(fig:price-plot-no-grid) indexed to
100 in June 2012, marking this value with a thin horizontal line at _y_
= 100 helps a lot (Figure @ref(fig:price-plot-refline)). Alternatively,
we can use a minimal "grid" of horizontal lines. For a plot where we are
primarily interested in the change in _y_ values, vertical grid lines
are not needed. Moreover, grid lines positioned at only the major axis
ticks will often be sufficient. And, the axis line can be omitted or
made very thin, since the horzontal lines clearly mark the extent of the
plot (Figure @ref(fig:price-plot-hgrid)).

(ref:price-plot-refline) Indexed stock price over time for four major
tech companies. Adding a thin horizontal line at the index value of 100
to Figure @ref(fig:price-plot-no-grid) helps provide an important
reference throughout the entire time period the plot spans. Data source:
Yahoo Finance

(#fig:price-plot-refline)(ref:price-plot-refline)

(ref:price-plot-hgrid) Indexed stock price over time for four major tech
companies. Adding thin horizontal lines at all major _y_ axis ticks
provides a better set of reference points than just the one horizontal
line of Figure @ref(fig:price-plot-refline). This design also removes
the need for prominent _x_ and _y_ axis lines, since the evenly spaced
horizontal lines create a visual frame for the plot panel. Data source:
Yahoo Finance

(#fig:price-plot-hgrid)(ref:price-plot-hgrid)

For such a minimal grid, we generally draw the lines orthogonally to
direction along which the numbers of interest vary. Therefore, if
instead of plotting the stock price over time we plot the five-year
increase, as horizontal bars, then we will want to use vertical lines
instead (Figure @ref(fig:price-increase)).

(ref:price-increase) Percent increase in stock price from June 2012 to
June 2017, for four major tech companies. Because the bars run
horizontally, vertical grid lines are appropriate here. Data source:
Yahoo Finance

(#fig:price-increase)(ref:price-increase)

Grid lines that run perpendicular to the key variable of interest tend
to be the most useful.

For bar graphs such as Figure @ref(fig:price-increase), @TufteQuantDispl
recommends to draw white grid lines on top of the bars instead of dark
grid lines underneath (Figure @ref(fig:price-increase-tufte)). These
white grid lines have the effect of separating the bars into distinct
segments of equal length. I'm of two minds on this style. On the one
hand, research into human perception suggests that breaking bars into
discrete segments helps the reader to perceive bar lengths
[@Haroz_et_al_2015]. On the other hand, to my eye the bars look like
they are falling apart and don't form a clear visual unit. In fact, I
used this style purposefully in Figure
@ref(fig:titanic-passengers-by-class-sex) to visually separate stacked
bars representing male and female passengers. Which effect dominates may
depend on the specific choices of bar width, distance between bars, and
thickness of the white grid lines. Thus, if you intend to use this
style, I encourage you to vary these parameters until you have a figure
that creates the desired visual effect.

(ref:price-increase-tufte) Percent increase in stock price from June
2012 to June 2017, for four major tech companies. White grid lines on
top of bars can help the reader perceive the relative lengths of the
bars. At the same time, they can also create the perception that the
bars are falling apart. Data source: Yahoo Finance

(#fig:price-increase-tufte)(ref:price-increase-tufte)

I would like to point out another downside of Figure
@ref(fig:price-increase-tufte). I had to move the percentage values
outside the bars, because the labels didn't fit into the final segments
of several of the bars. However, this choice inappropriately visually
elongates the bars and should be avoided whenever possible.

Background grids along both axis directions are most appropriate for
scatter plots where there is no primary axis of interest. Figure
@ref(fig:Aus-athletes-grid-good) at the beginning of this chapter
provides an example. When a figure has a full background grid, axis
lines are generally not needed (Figure
@ref(fig:Aus-athletes-grid-good)).

[[paired-data]]
Paired data
~~~~~~~~~~~

For figures where the relevant comparison is the _x_ = _y_ line, such as
in scatter plots of paired data, I prefer to draw a diagonal line rather
than a grid. For example, consider Figure @ref(fig:gene-expression),
which compares gene expression levels in a mutant virus to the
non-mutated (wild-type) variant. By drawing the diagonal line, we can
see immediately which genes are expressed higher or lower in the mutant
relative to the wild type. The same observation is much harder to make
when the figure has a background grid and no diagonal line (Figure
@ref(fig:gene-expression-bad)). Thus, even though Figure
@ref(fig:gene-expression-bad) looks pleasing, I label it as bad. In
particular, gene _10A_, which clearly has a reduced expression level in
the mutant relative to the wild-type (Figure @ref(fig:gene-expression)),
does not visually stand out in Figure @ref(fig:gene-expression-bad).

(ref:gene-expression) Gene expression levels in a mutant bacteriophage
T7 relative to wild-type. Gene expression levels are measured by mRNA
abundances, in transcripts per million (TPM). Each dot corresponds to
one gene. In the mutant bacteriophage T7, the promoter in front of gene
_9_ was deleted, and this resulted in reduced mRNA abundances of gene
_9_ as well as the neighboring genes _8_ and _10A_ (highlighted). Data
source: @Paffetal2018

(#fig:gene-expression)(ref:gene-expression)

(ref:gene-expression-bad) Gene expression levels in a mutant
bacteriophage T7 relative to wild-type. By plotting this dataset against
a background grid, instead of a diagonal line, we are obscuring which
genes are higher or lower in the mutant than in the wild-type
bacteriophage. Data source: @Paffetal2018

(#fig:gene-expression-bad)(ref:gene-expression-bad)

Of course we could take the diagonal line from Figure
@ref(fig:gene-expression) and add it on top of the background grid of
Figure @ref(fig:gene-expression-bad), to ensure that the relevant visual
reference is present. However, the resulting figure is getting quite
busy (Figure @ref(fig:gene-expression-ugly)). I had to make the diagonal
line darker so it would stand out against the background grid, but now
the data points almost seem to fade into the background. We could
ameliorate this issue by making the data points larger or darker, but
all considered I'd rather choose Figure @ref(fig:gene-expression).

(ref:gene-expression-ugly) Gene expression levels in a mutant
bacteriophage T7 relative to wild-type. This figure combines the
background grid from Figure @ref(fig:gene-expression-bad) with the
diagonal line from Figure @ref(fig:gene-expression). In my opinion, this
figure is visually too busy compared to Figure
@ref(fig:gene-expression), and I would prefer Figure
@ref(fig:gene-expression). Data source: @Paffetal2018

(#fig:gene-expression-ugly)(ref:gene-expression-ugly)

[[summary]]
Summary
~~~~~~~

Both overloading a figure with non-data ink and excessively erasing
non-data ink can result in poor figure design. We need to find a healthy
medium, where the data points are the main emphasis of the figure while
sufficient context is provided about what data is shown, where the
points lie relative to each other, and what they mean.

With respect to backgrounds and background grids, there is no one choice
that is preferable in all contexts. I recommend to be judicious about
grid lines. Think carefully about which specific grid or guide lines are
most informative for the plot you are making, and then only show those.
I prefer minimal, light grids on a white background, since white is the
default neutral color on paper and supports nearly any foreground color.
However, a shaded background can help the plot appear as a single visual
entity, and this may be particularly useful in small multiples plots.
Finally, we have to consider how all these choices relate to visual
branding and identity. Many magazines and websites like to have an
immediately recognizable in-house style, and a shaded background and
specific choice of background grid can help create a unique visual
identity.
